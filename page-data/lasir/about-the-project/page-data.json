An IR is a type of digital access and preservation system that focuses on institution-generated scholarly content. LASIR will build upon existing code to further develop these key IR features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search engine optimization (SEO) and Google Scholar integration</li>\n<li>Usage stats/impact factor/assessment, including system-generated visualizations of usage/content</li>\n<li>Enhanced author profiles for university and college faculty members</li>\n<li>A generalized and simplified self-deposit workflow</li>\n<li>Facilitate the ability to contribute to larger disciplinary networks</li>\n<li>Complete documentation that is accessible and thorough</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Why is LASIR Needed?</h2>\n<p>LASIR will advance Islandora’s position as a versatile, highly attractive, and affordable platform that will be a viable open-source alternative to commercial solutions. Elsevier’s recent acquisition of bepress™ is causing a wide range of academic institutions to seek an alternative non-proprietary IR platform where they can openly manage and share their scholarly output (e.g., articles, theses, and conference proceedings). For example, the University of Pennsylvania Libraries posted a public <a href=\"https://beprexit.wordpress.com/official-statement/\">press release</a> stating their termination of partnership with bepress™. The appeal of open-source IR platforms is that users can have more direct input on new feature development, alternative integrations, and future roadmap plans for their IR—an opportunity that a vendor-controlled repository system, such as Elsevier’s, does not provide. Open-source projects thrive on a vibrant community of users. By enabling Islandora as a destination for institutions seeking an open-source IR platform, LASIR seeks to enrich and add diversity to the already thriving, vibrant community of users associated with Islandora. LASIR, along with the complementary <a href=\"https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE\">ISLE</a> (Islandora Enterprise) project, seeks to enhance the features of Islandora while also making it a more sustainable platform and reducing start-up costs for new users.</p>\n<h2>Funding</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>LASIR Phase I:</strong> $41,000 crowdfunded ($35,000 from nine academic institutions: Hamilton College, Hampshire College, Grinnell College, Middlebury College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, Vassar College, Wesleyan University, Williams College; $6,000 in-kind labor from Born-Digital); met original goal of $41,000.</li>\n<li><strong>LASIR Phase II:</strong> Williams College, in partnership with the Islandora Collaboration Group (ICG) and in consultation with the Islandora Foundation, has received a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iN6-EH3PyhjFUms3SgNxRRXwbaK_780G9_O1rHAcaV4/view\">$153,000 grant from The Andrew W.

The development will then become a core part of the Islandora 7x Release (Fall 2019) and will be supported and maintained by the Islandora community as part of the free and publicly shared open-source platform. Through this LSAP method, Islandora has already adopted a large number of externally contributed modules that are sustainably maintained by community members.</p>\n<h2>LASIR Documents</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iRCOhiLRFoqEF3alOQiLEaK8-IGc1KArWLBMYv8xWEk/edit#heading=h.jkag9vqwplxh\">LASIR Executive Summary</a> (project overview)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributing to LASIR</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>LASIR meetings are open to everybody!
